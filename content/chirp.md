One of my long-term aspirations is to forge an emulator for the legendary [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy)
console. In my quest to gather knowledge and skills for this project, I decided
to write a virtual machine for the [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)
interpreted language from the mid-1970's. Although not a hardware emulation
project, it makes you dig a bit into techniques common to emulation.

The heart of [`chirp`](https://github.com/luizmugnaini/chirp) is an interpreter of
the CHIP-8 programming language, with roots in the early days of game
development. This project can serve as a learning material for someone
interested in dipping their toes in the world of emulation.

I tried to make the external dependencies as minimal as possible (being Rust,
this is quite the challenge):

- [`rand`](https://crates.io/crates/rand): most famous random number generation
  crate in the Rust ecosystem.
- [SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](https://www.libsdl.org/): cross-platform
  development library providing low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse,
  and graphics. SDL serves as the backbone for `chirp`, allowing you to
  interact with CHIP-8 games.

Throughout the creation of `chirp`, I found
[Cowgod's CHIP-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)
to be an invaluable resource, serving as the main reference for the project.

If you find any issues with the project, or even suggestions, I would be
pleased to hear them. You can open an issue or a pull request in the
github repository, or contact me directly.
